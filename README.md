libkit
======

This library contains useful standalone routines, supplying a basic
"kit" for developing C code.

The library contains tensor mathematical operations in kit-tensor.c 
that implement operations similar to those in PyTorch. For documentation
see: pytorch.org.

The build depends on the mak, libsxe and libjemalloc submodules which
must be checked out alongside libkit.
