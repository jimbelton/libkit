/*
 * This module implements fast thread safe counters. libkit uses it to track memory allocations.
 *
 * Theory of operation: Each thread has its own set of counters, which it can modify without locking. When a count is needed,
 * it's summed up from all the per thread counts. This is safe to do locklessly because the counts are stored in inherently
 * atomic integers.
 *
 * Currently, threads that don't explicitly allocate counters can use shared counters which are modified using atomic
 * instructions. This is comparatively slow, and so should be avoided. A typical use would be for threads created under the
 * control of a third party library. In future, we may deal with this via an injectable shim library that takes over thread
 * creation.
